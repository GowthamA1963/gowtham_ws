This workspace contains three ROS2 packages:
- `bot_description` ‚Äî URDF + plugins for the robot
- `bot_world` ‚Äî Custom Gazebo world with launch integration
- `bot_control` ‚Äî Laser scan reader and field-of-view filter node

---

## ‚úÖ Section 1

### 1. `bot_description` Package

This package contains the URDF/Xacro of the robot designed as per the mechanical diagram from **Bot_1.pdf**.

#### ‚úÖ Features implemented:
- Differential drive with **`libgazebo_ros_diff_drive.so`**
- **LIDAR sensor** with `libgazebo_ros_ray_sensor.so` plugin
- **RGB camera** with `libgazebo_ros_camera.so` plugin
- Joint state publisher GUI + robot_state_publisher
- All launch files required for visualization and control

#### üìÇ Key files:
- `urdf/robot.urdf.xacro`
- `launch/rviz.py` ‚Äî launches robot in RViz
- `launch/spawn.launch.py` ‚Äî spawns in Gazebo with default world and teleop keyboard integration


---

### 2. `bot_world` Package

This package includes a **custom world** that replicates the structure shown in the question (walls and cones).

#### ‚úÖ Features:
- World designed using Gazebo UI and exported
- Robot spawns **at the center** of the custom world
- Includes launch file to bring up the full simulation + RViz + teleop

#### üìÇ Key files:
- `worlds/obstacles.world`
- `launch/world.launch.py`

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitation:
- The **robot model currently does not spawn automatically** in the world due to unknown spawn behavior.
- The world loads successfully, and the robot can be added manually using:
  ```bash
  ros2 run gazebo_ros spawn_entity.py -topic robot_description -entity my_bot

## ‚úÖ Section 2

### 3. `bot_control` Package (In Progress)

This package is used to read and filter LIDAR scan data.

#### üöß Implemented so far:
- ROS2 C++ node (`reading_laser.cpp`) that subscribes to `/scan` (LIDAR)
- Reads and filters scan range to 0‚Äì120¬∞ field of view
- Publishes filtered result to `/filtered_scan`
- Launch file that runs both RViz and this node

#### üìÇ Key files:
- `scripts/reading_laser.cpp`
- `launch/control.launch.py`
